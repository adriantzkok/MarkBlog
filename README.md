# Easy Personal Blog V2! ‚úçÔ∏è

**Note, you can access a current version of this blog [here](https://adrian-blog.vercel.app/)!**

This is V2 of my personal blog project that I've been working on. It's a personal project that I created to replace my previous Notion and Vue blog and website. I also plan to make it more boilerplate-like so that anyone can use it as an easy setup to start blogging!

Significant changes from V1 include an update of the framework (now using Next.js), along with better performance and improved user interactivity.

## About üìù

This project is built using the **Next.js** framework for the frontend. For the backend, I utilized the **Supabase** API to store my blog post content and its associated metadata. To simplify the blog writing, I've chosen **Markdown** as the primary format for blog posts, which will be rendered on the frontend using rehype.
